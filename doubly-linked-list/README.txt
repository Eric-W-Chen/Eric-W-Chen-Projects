Eric Chen - Created a program that implemens a doubly linked list that implements an Insert, Member, Delete, Print, and Free_list option. The Insert function inserts a new node in correct alphabetical location in the list, the Print function prints the contents of the nodes in the list, the Member function searches the list for a string, the Delete function deletes a node containing the string, and the Free_node function frees the storage used by a node of the list. The program stores a list of strings, and stores the strings in increasing alphabetical order. The program does not store duplicate strings and effectively minimizes the use of memory for the list, so that the individual nodes in the list only store as many characters as are actually in the string. Furthermore, the program minimizes search times by exploiting the alphabetical ordering in the list, so that the Insert, Member, and Delete functions only search through the list as far as needed.
