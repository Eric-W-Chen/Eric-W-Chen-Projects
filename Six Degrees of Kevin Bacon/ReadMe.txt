I used the BFS algorithm as it's an unweighted graph so it would be the fastest algorithm to use to test the layers and find the shortest path as opposed to Dijkstra's which would take longer as it would test all the different possible paths. Did string splitting to get the JSONString to be parsable. 

I downloaded the json simple jar through this link: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple11jar.htm
