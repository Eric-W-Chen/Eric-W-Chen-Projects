Comments: It was pretty simple setting the constructors up as we've done it so many times before. The hardest part was determining the winner and creating the difference accessors, linking face name, and face values were hard as well. This was a pretty hard project. The Card.java sets the value of each face of the card, the deck of cards creates new card objects and puts them in a deck and makes methods where we can deal, shuffle, and count the number of cards in each deck.
