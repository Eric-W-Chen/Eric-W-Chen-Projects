Password Generator

This program generates a random "strong" password. The definition of a "strong" password is that it must be at least eight characters long, and must include at least one uppercase, one lowercase letter, and one digit. The password also cannot contain any special characters and must contain at least one string of consecutive letters of at least 4 letters long (uppercase, lowercase, or both). The password also should not contain the username. The user may decide to use the generated "strong" password or create their own.
