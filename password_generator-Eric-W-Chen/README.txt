The program works as required. It compiles/runs and output matches the correct format, excluding a very minor detail: when the user enters a wrong password, it tells the user what is wrong with the inputted password. Very sorry if you wanted the output to tell the user that the password was simply weak instead. I kept it this way to keep the program a little more user friendly. I also entered comments to help the readability of the code.
