Developed a multithreaded search-engine through full stack development. Created an inverted index to store the word being found, file
location to the word, and the index(es) that the word is found in the file. 
Parsed the lines into stemmed words in the text file to provide the user with consistent search results.
Outputted data in JSON format to develop a readable format.
Utilized multi-threading to allow simultaneous reading and writing to speed the runtime of the search engine by x2.869815.
Developed the front-end aspect of the project using a CSS template through HTML and a multithreaded web crawler to display the 
functional search-engine.
Utilized web crawler to optimize speed and Jetty to launch the application servlet to allow the search engine to be deployed.
Used JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to create an SSH tunnel to connect Java to the MariaDB database server on a separate computer.
